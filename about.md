# About myself

I am Bart Kiers, a software developer living in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I work at [DEAL Services](https://www.dealservices.nl/en/home), an [Almende](http://www.almende.com/home) spin-off, and sometimes do some freelance work

You can find me at:

* [stack**overflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/users/50476/bart-kiers)
* [Github](https://github.com/bkiers)
* my [old blog](http://bkiers.blogspot.com) with some ANTLR (3) tutorials

Feel free to contact me via e-mail. However, if you have a programming related question, please ask it on stackoverflow: I don't do private one-on-one consulting. At least, not for free :)
