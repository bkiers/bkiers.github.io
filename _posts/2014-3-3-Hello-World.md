I [once tried my hand at blogging](http://bkiers.blogspot.com), but Blogspot 
just doesn't feel right for me. The WYSIWYG editor isn't quite right, especially 
after being used to writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) ([stack**overflow**](http://stackoverflow.com) and [GitHub](http://github.com) 
both use Markdown extensively, as many sofware developers will know). And 
code-highlighting wasn't easy either: `<`'s and other html entities that needed 
to be escaped manually...
 
So, now I'm trying something else: [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), 
which pretty much boils down to (quote):
 
> Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub 
> hosted blogs (Jekyll Repository)
>
> Jekyll Now makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by 
> eliminating a lot of the up front setup.
 
And to edit (and create) blog posts, I will be giving [prose.io](http://prose.io) 
a try.
